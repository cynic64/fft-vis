*** this is a *scratch* buffer which won't be automatically saved ***

-42.3 db in EQ -> 0.006-ish vol
-36.1 db in EQ -> 0.0118 vol
-30.3 db in EQ -> 0.023 vol
-26.3 db in EQ -> 0.0377 vol
-24.3 db in EQ -> 0.0473 vol

So +6 db change led to ~2x (1.95) volume increase
Then +6 db led to ~2x (2.05) volume increase again

OK so somehow it's 6db for a 2x volume multiplier
